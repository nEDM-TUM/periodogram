Summary
-------

This is a simple python library for getting power spectra right. It is based on
the report "Spectrum and spectral density estimation by the Discrete Fourier
transform (DFT), including a comprehensive list of window functions and some
new at-top windows" by Gerhard Heinzel, Albrecht RÃ¼diger and Roland Schilling.
The report can be obtained at http://edoc.mpg.de/395068.

It supports the built-in numpy FFT functions as well as pyFFTW. Take a look at
the paper mentioned above for the right window function. The library is tested
with Python 2.7 and Python 3.3.
